            <p>In Ethiopia, the consumption of raw meat is a deeply rooted and cherished culinary tradition, 
                with popular dishes like kitfo, minced beef mixed with spiced butter and chili powder, 
                and tere siga, or cubes and strips of uncooked beef dipped in hot sauce, served as delicacies during celebrations and communal gatherings.<br>
                The practice has historical origins, with one prominent theory linking it to the 16th-century Ethiopian-Adal War, 
                where soldiers ate raw meat to avoid detection by enemies who could see cooking fires from a distance.<br>
                This practical wartime measure eventually evolved into a symbol of cultural identity, strength, and hospitality.<br>
                To minimize the inherent health risks of consuming raw beef, 
                Ethiopians rely on extremely fresh, high-quality meat, often sourced from trusted, 
                specialized butcher shops known as siga bet, and use spicy condiments like mitmita and awaze, which are an integral part of the flavor and, 
                some believe, the safety of the dish.<br>
                While the tradition persists, especially among certain ethnic groups and in urban centers, 
                health experts continue to advise caution, particularly for vulnerable populations, 
                highlighting the importance of thorough hygiene practices within the meat processing and preparation process
